				Meadows is a work in progress, the eventual goal being to develop the typeface into a family. In October 2017, it was awarded 2nd prize in the Updike Student Type Design Competition. 
				<br><br>
				I began designing Meadows in February 2017 and continued developing it with the guidance of the type designer Richard Lipton. The letterforms are inspired by the playful but somewhat sinister tone of the Scandinavian folktale The Three Billy Goats Gruff. The green pastures of this folktale are the place from which Meadows takes its name.

				Many typefaces have served to inspire as Meadows has evolved. One of the most considered has been Garamond (both regular and bold), which I first consciously borrowed from when accentuating Meadows’s serifs with slight “dips.”

				Subconsciously, I believe I was also inspired by Dutch letterforms. This was first brought to my attention when the type historian Paul Shaw viewed Meadows during a class visit at RISD. He noted that it appeared to him “Dutch” in style. Several months later, I came across a book of seventeenth century Dutch specimens. Those terminals sure looked familiar!
