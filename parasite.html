                In Branding class at RISD, I was tasked with creating a new, hypothetical identity for The Parasite Museum. The museum is a research facility which boasts a wild collection of parasitic specimens. I sought to promote this collection with forms that are at once playful, inviting, and scientific.

                The parasitic counter of the logo’s &ldquo;P&rdquo; form sometimes takes on a life of its own, rolling independent of its host through various applications. Above it is shown in a dependent state.

                Brand extension proposal:<br><br> During the research phase, I discovered that parasite extinction is a looming threat. To combat this, I conceived of an exhibition/fundraiser, titled &ldquo;Citizen Parasite.&rdquo; The goals: reverse parasite demonization and raise money for research. The poster set below was designed as part of the extension:

                Process:<br><br>
                My research for the identity began with a whole lot of reference imagery and five sheets of butcher paper. Each sheet was dedicated to one of the following categories: Words, Abstract Imagery, Actions, Materials/Media, and Sketches/Wordplay. I filled them with notes and drawings from research, as well as ideas for directions I might go.

                I then began sketching further for the logo. In ideation, I drew from images I had collected of parasites, the inner body, and key words I had written. The eventual logo was selected, with the help of my peers, for its versatility and friendliness. Spot it below!
