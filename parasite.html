                In Branding class at RISD, I was tasked with creating a new, hypothetical identity for The Parasite Museum. The museum is a research facility which boasts a wild collection of parasitic specimens. I sought to promote this collection with forms that are at once playful, inviting, and scientific.

                 The Parasite Museum’s new &ldquo;P&rdquo; logo was drawn with a nod to bodily organ forms. Its parasitic counter sometimes takes on a life of its own.

                At this point, you might be wondering where the purple came from. Parasite Purple is a color born of trial. When I first drew the logo, I had a soft pink in mind—we are all pink-ish inside, after all. But no pink quite had the pop I was looking for, so I gave pink-purple a go. There was the pop.

                The posters below are part of the exhibition/campaign &ldquo;Citizen Parasite&rdquo;, the purpose of which is to educate on how parasites contribute to ecosystems worldwide. Parasite extinction is a looming threat, and awareness is key to disrupting this threat. <br><br>
                The new color &ldquo;Endo Green&rdquo; was employed for the campaign, in addition to Parasite Purple.

                My research for the identity began with a whole lot of reference imagery and five sheets of butcher paper. Each sheet was dedicated to one of the following categories: Words, Abstract Imagery, Actions, Materials/Media, and Sketches/Wordplay. I filled them with notes and drawings from research, as well as ideas for directions I might go.

                I then began sketching further for the logo. In ideation, I drew from images I had collected of parasites, the inner body, and key words I had written. The eventual logo was selected, with the help of my peers, for its versatility and friendliness. Spot it below!
