                   The graphic design senior show took place in early March of 2018 at Woods Gerry Gallery. As a member of the show’s committee, I worked as copywriter and as one of several exhibition organizers.

                    Another feature of the exhibition I worked on was the type wall—literally, a freestanding wall with obscure pangrams projected onto it. Each of the fifteen typefaces (projected in groups of 5) was designed by a member of the senior class. The wall looked something like this:
